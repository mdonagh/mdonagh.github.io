Injecting Ruby

.erb means "embedded ruby"

This means that the HTML pages in your rails application can easily inject Ruby!

If you need to put a variable in - for example, to show patient page 555

`<a href="/patients/<%= patient.id %>">Show patient <%= patient.name %></a>`

For an image
`<img src="<%= image.url%>">`

You can inject ruby anywhere!

Either put the ruby directly there

`<%= patient.name %>`

However, you can also CALL A RUBY METHOD usually done for loops or to instantiate a form

`<% @patients.each do |patient %>`
`<h1><=% patient.name %></h1>`
`<b><%= patient.complaint %></b>`
`<% end %>`

Notice the difference for running ruby vs printing ruby to the html page is `<%=` for print vs `<%` for no print (also can do `<%-` for no-print)

This is a very common pattern of iterating over a variable and printing its attributes into html.
